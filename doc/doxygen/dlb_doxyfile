# Doxyfile 1.7.6.1

# This file describes the settings to be used by the documentation system
# doxygen (www.doxygen.org) for a project.
#
# All text after a hash (#) is considered a comment and will be ignored.
# The format is:
#       TAG = value [value, ...]
# For lists items can also be appended using:
#       TAG += value [value, ...]
# Values that contain spaces should be placed between quotes (" ").

# Omitted tags are assumed to be default (see standard Doxyfile).

#---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Project related configuration options
#---------------------------------------------------------------------------

# The PROJECT_NAME tag is a single word (or sequence of words) that should
# identify the project. Note that if you do not use Doxywizard you need
# to put quotes around the project name if it contains spaces.

PROJECT_NAME           = "Dolby mp4 demuxer API Reference"

# The PROJECT_NUMBER tag can be used to enter a project or revision number.
# This could be handy for archiving the generated documentation or
# if some version control system is used.

PROJECT_NUMBER         = "v1.0.0"

# If the FULL_PATH_NAMES tag is set to YES then Doxygen will prepend the full
# path before files name in the file list and in the header files. If set
# to NO the shortest path that makes the file name unique will be used.

FULL_PATH_NAMES        = NO

# The TAB_SIZE tag can be used to set the number of spaces in a tab.
# Doxygen uses this value to replace tabs by spaces in code fragments.

TAB_SIZE               = 4

# Set the OPTIMIZE_OUTPUT_FOR_C tag to YES if your project consists of C
# sources only. Doxygen will then generate output that is more tailored for C.
# For instance, some of the names that are used will be different. The list
# of all members will be omitted, etc.

OPTIMIZE_OUTPUT_FOR_C  = YES

#---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Build related configuration options
#---------------------------------------------------------------------------

# If the HIDE_SCOPE_NAMES tag is set to NO (the default) then Doxygen
# will show members with their full class and namespace scopes in the
# documentation. If set to YES the scope will be hidden.

HIDE_SCOPE_NAMES       = YES

# The GENERATE_TODOLIST tag can be used to enable (YES) or
# disable (NO) the todo list. This list is created by putting \todo
# commands in the documentation.

GENERATE_TODOLIST      = NO

# The GENERATE_TESTLIST tag can be used to enable (YES) or
# disable (NO) the test list. This list is created by putting \test
# commands in the documentation.

GENERATE_TESTLIST      = NO

# The GENERATE_BUGLIST tag can be used to enable (YES) or
# disable (NO) the bug list. This list is created by putting \bug
# commands in the documentation.

GENERATE_BUGLIST       = NO

# The GENERATE_DEPRECATEDLIST tag can be used to enable (YES) or
# disable (NO) the deprecated list. This list is created by putting
# \deprecated commands in the documentation.

GENERATE_DEPRECATEDLIST= NO

# The LAYOUT_FILE tag can be used to specify a layout file which will be parsed
# by doxygen. The layout file controls the global structure of the generated
# output files in an output format independent way. The create the layout file
# that represents doxygen's defaults, run doxygen with the -l option.
# You can optionally specify a file name after the option, if omitted
# DoxygenLayout.xml will be used as the name of the layout file.

LAYOUT_FILE            = dlb_layout.xml

#---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# configuration options related to warning and progress messages
#---------------------------------------------------------------------------

# The WARN_NO_PARAMDOC option can be enabled to get warnings for
# functions that are documented, but have no documentation for their parameters
# or return value. If set to NO (the default) doxygen will only warn about
# wrong or incomplete parameter documentation, but not about the absence of
# documentation.

WARN_NO_PARAMDOC       = YES

# The WARN_LOGFILE tag can be used to specify a file to which warning
# and error messages should be written. If left blank the output is written
# to stderr.

WARN_LOGFILE           = warn.log

#---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# configuration options related to the input files
#---------------------------------------------------------------------------

# The INPUT tag can be used to specify the files and/or directories that contain
# documented source files. You may enter file names like "myfile.cpp" or
# directories like "/usr/src/myproject". Separate the files or directories
# with spaces.

INPUT                  = ../../src ../../include

# If the value of the INPUT tag contains directories, you can use the
# FILE_PATTERNS tag to specify one or more wildcard pattern (like *.cpp
# and *.h) to filter out the source-files in the directories. If left
# blank the following patterns are tested:
# *.c *.cc *.cxx *.cpp *.c++ *.d *.java *.ii *.ixx *.ipp *.i++ *.inl *.h *.hh
# *.hxx *.hpp *.h++ *.idl *.odl *.cs *.php *.php3 *.inc *.m *.mm *.dox *.py
# *.f90 *.f *.for *.vhd *.vhdl

FILE_PATTERNS          = *.c \
                         *.h \
                         *.inc \
                         *.dox

# The RECURSIVE tag can be used to turn specify whether or not subdirectories
# should be searched for input files as well. Possible values are YES and NO.
# If left blank NO is used.

RECURSIVE              = YES

# The EXCLUDE tag can be used to specify files and/or directories that should be
# excluded from the INPUT source files. This way you can easily exclude a
# subdirectory from a directory tree whose root is specified with the INPUT tag.
# Note that relative paths are relative to the directory from which doxygen is
# run.

EXCLUDE                =

# The IMAGE_PATH tag can be used to specify one or more files or
# directories that contain image that are included in the documentation (see
# the \image command).

IMAGE_PATH             = ./image

#---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# configuration options related to source browsing
#---------------------------------------------------------------------------

# If the SOURCE_BROWSER tag is set to YES then a list of source files will
# be generated. Documented entities will be cross-referenced with these sources.
# Note: To get rid of all source code in the generated output, make sure also
# VERBATIM_HEADERS is set to NO.

SOURCE_BROWSER         = YES

#---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# configuration options related to the HTML output
#---------------------------------------------------------------------------

# The HTML_FOOTER tag can be used to specify a personal HTML footer for
# each generated HTML page. If it is left blank doxygen will generate a
# standard footer.

HTML_FOOTER            = dlb_footer.html

# The HTML_STYLESHEET tag can be used to specify a user-defined cascading
# style sheet that is used by each HTML page. It can be used to
# fine-tune the look of the HTML output. If the tag is left blank doxygen
# will generate a default style sheet. Note that doxygen will try to copy
# the style sheet file to the HTML output directory, so don't put your own
# style sheet in the HTML output directory as well, or it will be erased!

HTML_STYLESHEET        = dlb_stylesheet.css

# The HTML_EXTRA_FILES tag can be used to specify one or more extra images or
# other source files which should be copied to the HTML output directory. Note
# that these files will be copied to the base HTML output directory. Use the
# $relpath$ marker in the HTML_HEADER and/or HTML_FOOTER files to load these
# files. In the HTML_STYLESHEET file, use the file name only. Also note that
# the files will be copied as-is; there are no commands or markers available.

HTML_EXTRA_FILES       = dlb_dolby_logo.png

# The DISABLE_INDEX tag can be used to turn on/off the condensed index (tabs)
# at top of each HTML page. The value NO (the default) enables the index and
# the value YES disables it. Since the tabs have the same information as the
# navigation tree you can set this option to NO if you already set
# GENERATE_TREEVIEW to YES.

DISABLE_INDEX          = YES

# The GENERATE_TREEVIEW tag is used to specify whether a tree-like index
# structure should be generated to display hierarchical information.
# If the tag value is set to YES, a side panel will be generated
# containing a tree-like index structure (just like the one that
# is generated for HTML Help). For this to work a browser that supports
# JavaScript, DHTML, CSS and frames is required (i.e. any modern browser).
# Windows users are probably better off using the HTML help feature.
# Since the tree basically has the same information as the tab index you
# could consider to set DISABLE_INDEX to NO when enabling this option.

GENERATE_TREEVIEW      = YES

#---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# configuration options related to the LaTeX output
#---------------------------------------------------------------------------

# If the GENERATE_LATEX tag is set to YES (the default) Doxygen will
# generate Latex output.

GENERATE_LATEX         = NO

#---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# configuration options related to the RTF output
#---------------------------------------------------------------------------

# If the GENERATE_RTF tag is set to YES Doxygen will generate RTF output
# The RTF output is optimized for Word 97 and may not look very pretty with
# other RTF readers or editors.

GENERATE_RTF           = YES

#---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Configuration options related to the preprocessor
#---------------------------------------------------------------------------

# If the MACRO_EXPANSION tag is set to YES Doxygen will expand all macro
# names in the source code. If set to NO (the default) only conditional
# compilation will be performed. Macro expansion can be done in a controlled
# way by setting EXPAND_ONLY_PREDEF to YES.

MACRO_EXPANSION        = YES

# If the EXPAND_ONLY_PREDEF and MACRO_EXPANSION tags are both set to YES
# then the macro expansion is limited to the macros specified with the
# PREDEFINED and EXPAND_AS_DEFINED tags.

EXPAND_ONLY_PREDEF     = YES

# The PREDEFINED tag can be used to specify one or more macro names that
# are defined before the preprocessor is started (similar to the -D option of
# gcc). The argument of the tag is a list of macros of the form: name
# or name=definition (no spaces). If the definition and the = are
# omitted =1 is assumed. To prevent a macro definition from being
# undefined via #undef or recursively expanded use the := operator
# instead of the = operator.

PREDEFINED             = ENABLE_MP4_MSGLOG
